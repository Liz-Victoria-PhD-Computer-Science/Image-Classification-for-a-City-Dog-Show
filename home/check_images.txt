Questions regarding Uploaded Image Classification:

1. Did the three model architectures classify the breed of dog in Dog_01.jpg to be the same breed? If not, report the differences in the classifications.

Answer: No. Dog_01.jpg true breed is a yorkshire terrier. 
ResNet classified Dog_01.jpg as a silky terrier, sydney silky.
AlexNet classified Dog_01.jpg as a yorkshire terrier. 
VGG classified Dog_01.jpg as a an australian terrier.


2. Did each of the three model architectures classify the breed of dog in Dog_01.jpg to be the same breed of dog as that model architecture classified Dog_02.jpg? If not, report the differences in the classifications.

Answer: For ResNet and AlexNet, yes. For VGG, no. 
ResNet classified Dog_02.jpg as a silky terrier, sydney silky. (This is the same breed
that ResNet classified Dog_01.jpg as).
AlexNet classified Dog_02.jpg as a yorkshire terrier. (This is the same breed
that AlexNet classified Dog_01.jpg as).
VGG classified Dog_02.jpg as a an silky terrier, sydney silky. (But VGG classified
Dog_01.jpg as an australian terrier).


3. Did the three model architectures correctly classify Animal_Name_01.jpg and Object_Name_01.jpg to not be dogs? If not, report the misclassifications.

Answer: All three architectures understood that the object (Stapler_01.jpg) is not a dog.
However, two architectures did classify the animal (Sugar_gliser_01.jpg) as a dog, 
which is incorrect.

ResNet classified Sugar_glider_01.jpg as chihuahua. This is incorrect. A sugar glider
is not a dog.
ResNet classified Stapler_01.jpg as modem. This is an object, not a dog! 

AlexNet classified Sugar_glider_01.jpg as chihuahua. This is incorrect. A sugar glider
is not a dog.
AlexNet classified Stapler_01.jpg as mouse, computer mouse. This is an object, not a dog!

VGG classified Sugar_glider_01.jpg as egyptian cat, cat. This is not a dog! Yay!
VGG classified Stapler_01.jpg as printer. This is an object, not a dog!


4. Based upon your answers for questions 1. - 3. above, select the model architecture that you feel did the best at classifying the four uploaded images. Describe why you selected that model architecture as the best on uploaded image classification.

Answer: VGG is the best model architecture for classifying the four uploaded images.
VGG classified the dog as an australian terrier. I looked up this dog breed, and it is 
very similar to the images of the dog I chose (a yorkshire terrier).
Also, VGG was the only model architecture able to determine that the Sugar_glider_01.jpg 
was not a dog. Furthermore, VGG had a consistent dog breed for Dog_01.jpg and Dog_02.jpg. 
The other two architectures changed the dog breed for the flipped image, however,
VGG stayed consistent and showed the dog breed was australian terrier for both
Dog_01.jpg and Dog_02.jpg, which is encouraging because these images are the exact 
same dog, only flipped horizontally. I really enjoyed this project!
